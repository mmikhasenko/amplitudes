That is an experimental repositiry to practice with julia language.

# notebooks:

 - "Delta in GlueX". Few plots for the analysis of Jon Zarling, Indiana
 - "Triangle diagram". Calculation of the triangle diagram using Feynman method (see the [publication](https://inspirehep.net/record/1341619)).
 - "Number of partitions". A little exercise related to Group Theory course I thougth. Recursive calculation of an amount of ways to split a positive integer to a sum of positive integers.
 - Tensor-Helicity folder: exploratory notebooks as well as final publication plotting scripts for the "Tensor-Helicity" project. (related to Zc(4430) analysis of LHCb, see the publication, [arXiv:1712.02815](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02815)).
 - "EtaPi phase space analysis". Demonstration how to do phase space MC with julia, related to a Bachelor project of Waldemar Renz.
